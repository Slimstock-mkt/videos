Hi Marco Guerreiro  thank you very much for all the work! Here is my feedback, considering we can not have our "dream pages" for now hehe:
 
I will send the feedback in different messages
 
# VIDEO HUB:
##P arent page:
There is a section missing: "Knowledge and trends" that it should go first please, the rest of the order is fine.
*Future: to have filters on industry and type of content hehe (I know os not for now)
Cards:
## CTA Play Video: I think it can't go where it is, because the letters won't be seen with the video image, it should go on the card, is it possible?
Date and topic: Can we add the date & topic as the resources cards please? link
Question: if a person plays on the category, the modulo will pop-up, rigth?
Episodes: 
This is something we haven't considered, but if we do knowledge video capsules and make them like episodes (David once said this):
Could we design what the cards for the episodes would look like? (SEE IMAGE A)
Could the module have arrows to see the next video/episode?
The CTA should be "Watch series"
## Category page:
### Filter: 
it should be like the customer one, with a filter and a search bar, right? (SEE IMAGE B)
Regarding the filters could the button "Apply filters" could be in another color? is lost to sight
Module:
## CTA: could we have the design of the external CTA as well? with a subtitle and button please
